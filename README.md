# PS5 Browser_appCache_remove

Removes the browser and User Guide appCache for all users...

Version 1.0 by Storm

Because the Function setting (Settings/System/Web Browser/Clear Website Data) on the PS5 doesn't do anything.
In any case, nothing is deleted for me when I have a page in the offline cache.
That's why I made this payload: All offline cache files for all users are deleted.
Tested on PS5 4.03.
The files can also be deleted manually with FTPS5...
